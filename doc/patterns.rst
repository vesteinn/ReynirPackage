Patterns
========

This section describes matching patterns that can be used with the
:py:meth:`SimpleTree.match()` method.

Overview
--------

The :py:meth:`SimpleTree.match()` method can be used to find trees and subtrees that match
a specific grammatical pattern. For instance, they can be used to find all subject
noun phrases in a sentence, or -- as a more complex case -- all
prepositional phrases within a sentence that contain masculine singular noun phrases.
