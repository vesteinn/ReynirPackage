    This module encapsulates access to the BIN (Beygingarlýsing íslensks nútímamáls)
    database of word forms, including lookup of abbreviations and basic strategies
    for handling missing words.

    The database is assumed to be packed into a compressed binary file,
    which is wrapped inside the bincompress.py module.

    Word meaning lookups are cached in Least Frequently Used (LFU) caches.

    This code must be thread safe.
