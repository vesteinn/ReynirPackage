    The compound word analyzer takes a word not found in the
    BIN word database and attempts to resolve it into parts
    as a compound word.

    It uses a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG) internally
    to store a large set of words in an efficient structure in terms
    of storage and speed.

    The graph is pre-built and stored in a file that
    is loaded at run-time by DawgDictionary.
